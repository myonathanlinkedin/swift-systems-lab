# Count-Min Sketch Heavy Hitters Frequency Estimator in Swift

An in-memory reference implementation of **Count-Min Sketch Heavy Hitters Frequency Estimator** in **Swift**, adhering to standard library idioms, clean data structures, and assertion test suites.

## Implementation Details

* **Category**: `Algorithmic Engineering`
* **Data Structure Foundation**: `Standard Memory Primitives`
* **Allocation Pattern**: Buffer boundaries and collection indices are explicitly validated to prevent out-of-bounds access.
* **Invariant Integrity**: State transitions follow clear ordering guarantees with explicit validation at each phase.

## Performance Characteristics

* **Time**: `O(N)` average, with `O(1)` best-case response under ideal conditions.
* **Space**: `O(N)` memory usage.

## Test Harness

To compile and execute the test assertions for this module:

```bash
swift main.swift
```
