# Async Concurrency: Where does the scheduler live? in Swift

A clean, dependency-free **Swift** reference implementation of **Async Concurrency: Where does the scheduler live?**, focused on core algorithmic mechanics, clear memory layout, and test verification.

## Implementation Details

* **Category**: `Algorithmic Engineering`
* **Data Structure Foundation**: `Standard Memory Primitives`
* **Allocation Pattern**: Buffer boundaries and collection indices are explicitly validated to prevent out-of-bounds access.
* **Invariant Integrity**: Execution behavior is validated against nominal workflows and boundary edge cases.

## Performance Characteristics

* **Time**: `O(N)` average, with `O(1)` best-case response under ideal conditions.
* **Space**: `O(N)` memory usage.

## Test Harness

To compile and execute the test assertions for this module:

```bash
swift main.swift
```
