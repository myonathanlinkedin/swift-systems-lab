# Async Concurrency: Where does the scheduler live? in Swift

A clean, dependency-free **Swift** implementation of **Async Concurrency: Where does the scheduler live?**, focused on predictable latency, strict memory layout, and deterministic execution.

## Implementation Details

* **Category**: `Algorithmic Engineering`
* **Data Structure Foundation**: `Standard Memory Primitives`
* **Allocation Pattern**: Buffer boundaries are strictly verified to prevent out-of-bounds access and memory leak hazards.
* **Invariant Integrity**: Deterministic behavior across all execution cycles, resilient against asynchronous edge conditions.

## Performance Characteristics

* **Time**: `$O(N)$` average, with `$O(1)$` best-case response under ideal conditions.
* **Space**: `$O(N)$` memory usage.

## Test Harness

To compile and execute the test assertions for this module:

```bash
swift main.swift
```
