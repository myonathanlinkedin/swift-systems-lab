# A minimal kernel in Swift, running in QEMU

Core **Swift** implementation for **A minimal kernel in Swift, running in QEMU**, structured for computational clarity, explicit data structures, and deterministic unit test coverage.

### Core Highlights
* **Language & Standard**: Modern `Swift` standard library conventions.
* **Architecture Pattern**: Designed for `Algorithmic Engineering` using `Standard Memory Primitives`.
* **Runtime Overhead**: Buffer boundaries and collection indices are explicitly validated to prevent out-of-bounds access.
* **Concurrency & Safety**: Execution behavior is validated against nominal workflows and boundary edge cases.

### Complexity Analysis

| Dimension | Bound |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Time (Best Case)** | `O(1)` |
| **Time (Worst Case)** | `O(N log N)` |
| **Auxiliary Space** | `O(N)` |

---

### Test Suite Execution

Self-contained verification drivers are embedded directly in `main.swift` to validate happy paths, boundary inputs, and invariant preservation.

```bash
swift main.swift
```
